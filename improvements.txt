The filter allows the user to select a venue and see all events taking
place at that venue. This could create problems for users in the event
of similar venue names, or venue names where the location is ambiguous.

The filter could be improved by showing the name of the city rather
than the venue where the show will take place. It could also include
more information like minimum price of tickets.

Other features that could be implemented in the future include
allowing users to select multiple locations, and allow selections
of specific venues within a particular city by creating a React
component with nested options.
